# Assignment 02: Pilot UT for Remento, Samantha Alexis Manuel, DH110 

## User Testing

Remento is an app that claims to provide their users with thoughtful prompts, simple recording tools and a beautiful private library that makes it easy to collect the stories that matter most. The purpose of Remento is to provide its users with the tools they need to create an accessible and collaborative digital archive of family memories.

For this assignment, I performed a usability test for Remento. It’s helpful to conduct usability tests in order to fully evaluate an app’s functionality and interface. This kind of testing centers around the perspective of the user, in order to uncover new ways of improving the app’s usability and experience. For these same reasons, that is why I have recorded the test sessions which will later be used for analysis with the data collected from the survey. For this User Testing Session, the user completed 4 tasks and was asked to describe their thought process/opinions while doing so. 

I intentionally created tasks that relate to the heuristic evaluation I conducted previously:

* Help and Documentation not presented in context, rather, when you open the help center, you are redirected to the site (*#10: Help and documentation*)
* Lacking an immediate solution, you must exit to the navigation menu and choose either “Help & Info” or “Contact Remento” to solve the error (*#9: Help users * recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors*)
* Forced to go through a tutorial (where you must upload a picture or record voice/video) (*#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use*)
* Lack of a tab which indicates history of work made on individual projects (*#6: Recognition rather than recall*)

I performed the usability test on Zoom, using a laptop to record the session while the user screen recorded their experience on the phone. The user is very close to the type of people I envisioned using this app (young adults seeking to connect with their grandparents).  

By the end of the survey, the following were measured: 
* First Impressions of the app
* Ease/Difficulty of use
* Flexibility of use 
* Recognition/Recall of work 
* Access to Help/Support
* Time Spent
* System Usability Scale 
* General Opinions/Thoughts

## Improving User Testing 

During the pilot test, I learned that despite having a wonderful interface, the user had moderate difficulty in navigating the application. Overall she thought the app was creative and innovative, but intimidating, time consuming, and unprofessional because of all the roadblocks she faced while doing the tasks. 

**What went well:**
* User was very vocal about opinions and thoughts throughout the whole process
* Survey was clear and detailed, allowing the user to voice all concerns regarding the app
* Trust between the user and the moderator 

**What did not do well:**
* Inability to skip tutorial (when she preferred to)
* No Savepoint (when accidentally sliding back), scared that she lost the content she just recorded
* Difficulty in creating new prompts (not clear on how to do this)
* Having to navigate multiple webpages to finally contact the team for support
* Two zoom links had to be provided since my account only had 40 minutes 
* User was frozen at some points of the recording, some connectivity issues disrupted the flow of the pilot testing 

In future usability testing, I would prefer to perform the test in an environment with the user themself. The connectivity issues and having to resend a zoom felt disruptive. It would also make the process of recording easier (in terms of interaction of the app).
